## 💼 Business Value Proposition

### The Problem
Myanmar's job market suffers from a critical disconnect: companies struggle to find qualified talent, talented individuals miss opportunities due to lack of connections, and existing global solutions fail because they don't support local payment methods (KBZPay, WavePay), messaging preferences (Viber/Telegram), or Burmese language.

### The Solution
TRM creates a win-win-win ecosystem:
- **Companies** access pre-vetted candidates through trusted referral networks
- **Referrers** monetize professional networks (earn 85% of referral bonuses)
- **Candidates** receive AI-optimized resumes and professional advocacy
